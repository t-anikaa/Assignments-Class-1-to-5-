1. Write code in JS: 
Declare two variables, then assign your first name and last name. Finally, print your full name including one space between both names.

var firstName = "Anika";
var lastName = "Tahsin";
var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
console.log(fullName);

The output will be Anika Tahsin.

2. Write code in JS:    Suppose a = 5, b = "60". Use type conversion and print the sum of the two variables.

var a = 5;
var b = "60";
var bNumber = parseInt(b);
console.log(bNumber);
//the output will be 60

Again,
var sum = a + bNumber;
console.log(sum);
the output will be 65.

3. Write code in JS: Num1 = 59, txt1 = "hello JS". Compare both variables and print the result.

var Num1 = 59;
var txt1 = "hello JS";
console.log(Num1 == txt1);

the output will be false.

4. Write code in JS: Num2 = 344, txtNum = "344". Compare the value of both variables along with the data type and print the result.

var Num2 = 344;
var txtNum = "344";
console.log(Num2 ===txtNum);

the output will be false as Num2 is a number type data and txtNum is string type data

5. Run the below code in JS, write your output:

var oddNum = 75;
var evenNum = 90;
var boolValue = oddNum !== evenNum;
console.log(boolValue);

The output will be true.
